# Project

## Prerequisites

Our app is based around common shiny strucutre. The server.R and ui.R are the primary files that run on server. appParts.R and readData.R and global.R are helper files for things like data cleaning. In addition, data is stored inside this folder that is required during the Shiny cloud upload.
