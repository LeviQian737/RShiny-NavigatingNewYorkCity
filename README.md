# Project 2: Visiting NYC in Covid-19

### [Project Description](doc/project2_desc.md)

We are presenting a webpage showing various aspacts of NYC during the the covid-19 pandemic. We want this to feel like a targeted blog, users can explore every aspect of NYC and compare the areas of NYC by themselves to choose where to go. These will be backed up by statistics relating and comparing the different districts. 

Ideas for the aspects we want to cover: 

- Kaimin - Safety data
- Noah - Cleanliness and loudness metric. Visibility
- Weixun - Events
- Kexin - Restaurant Location & Seating/Inspection


Ideally, each statistics will be calculated once for the last 20 months and then one more recently (like a last 7 days or a last 30 days).

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on the work of a **NYC government agency/program** of your choice using NYC open data released on the [NYC Open Data By Agency](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/) website. In particular, many agencies have adjusted their work or rolled out new programs due to COVID, your app should provide ways for a user to explore quantiative measures of how covid has impacted daily life in NYC from different prospectives. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

+ **Project summary**: 
During the covid-19 pandemic, people's lives changed dramatically, especially for poeple living in big cities like New York. 
In order to control the number of confirmed cases, restarurants experienced closing in the earlier stage of covid-19 and reopening in the summer time, when they could sell food for takeout or delivery. Within the popularization of covid vaccines, restaurants are allowed to provide outdoor dinning, including on the sidewalk or roadway. 
Another aspect which influenced greatly by covid-19 is the safety issue. As the rise in unemployments and economic downturn caused by covid, instable social events happened more frequently and people need more and more security. The safety part is extremely important for poeple in NYC. 
NYC is a big international city. For people who travel to NYC, one of the most helpful things is the introduction of events. There are various museums, parks, landmarks, performances all over the NYC, with different opening time.
