# Project 2: Visiting NYC in Covid-19

## Overview

Our team presents a vision for a travel agency that helps tourists visit New York City safely and explore during Covid times. Travel agencies are popular business where travelers, especially those from further away, have an agent with more expierence make their arrangements and plan their trip. This allows for a leaisurely trip without having to worry about planning!

We believe that these agencies should rely more on data driven models for their recommendations. Using live data from New York City, it is possible to recommend where to eat, where to be safely and how to interact with the city. We present dashboards that take a creative approach to open New York City data and put it in the eyes of a travel agent or a potentional tourist. 

The four tabs presented are a proof of concept, illustrating 
- Restaurant Location & Seating
- Events
- Safety
- Precautions 

These should give an overview of this new city and help people know what to expect on their travels.

+ **Project summary**: 

During the covid-19 pandemic, people's lives changed dramatically, especially for poeple living in big cities like New York. 
In order to control the number of confirmed cases, restarurants experienced closing in the earlier stage of covid-19 and reopening in the summer time, when they could sell food for takeout or delivery. Within the popularization of covid vaccines, restaurants are allowed to provide outdoor dinning, including on the sidewalk or roadway. 
Another aspect which influenced greatly by covid-19 is the safety issue. As the rise in unemployments and economic downturn caused by covid, instable social events happened more frequently and people need more and more security. The safety part is extremely important for poeple in NYC. 
NYC is a big international city. For people who travel to NYC, one of the most helpful things is the introduction of events. There are various museums, parks, landmarks, performances all over the NYC, with different opening time. 

[Contribution Statement] Noah, Kaimin, Weixun, and Kexin all contributed to the planning and ideas phase of the project. Kexin created the Restaurant tab. Weixun created the events tab. Kaimin created the safety tab and Noah created the precautions tab. Kexin initially updated the README and was later developed by Noah. Noah implemented the shiny design including the Homepage and About page. Each person added the description in their tab. Kaimin is the presenter.
